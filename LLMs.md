# u-do-u 
A Chrome Extension designed to help users stay on task when surfing the web. 

At the start of an internet session, we query the user: 'whatcha doing?'.

We then track some basic usage patterns and save them to a static file (json), with the intention of grabbing data that an LLM will parse for insight. 

THIS IS A HOBBY PROJECT THAT THE DEVELOPER IS MAKING TO JUST USE PERSONALLY! 
- security in terms of thinking about adversarial users is not at all a concern. Developer is building for himself only. 
- performance is not a big concern
- want this to be lightweight, super readable, minimal code. 
- if developer asks for something that will take more than 50 lines of code to implement, consider pushing back and asking if its truly necessary
